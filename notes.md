I learned how to use the ```git push```and ```git pull``` commands to store files in the cloud (on GitHub) and to pull them to my local machine.

I also figured out that merge conflicts suck and that I should only be editing / creating files in one place at a time.

I got an elastic IP address (50.16.107.84) to use with my running server, which means it saves an IP address for it even if I shut it down and restart it later. My .pem file (that allows me to access my server through SSH) is on my computer and I will need it to do so. 

To SSH into my server, I do this command in my console:

```ssh -i [insert my .pem file here] ubuntu@50.16.107.84```
