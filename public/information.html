            <p>A tabletop roleplaying game, often abbreviated "TTRPG", is a game where players take on the role of adventurers in an exciting adventure crafted by a special player known as the "Game Master".
                This player comes up with an adventure for the rest, such as finding an ancient tomb of treasure or saving a 
                town from a dragon's wrath, and the others act within the adventure by roleplaying the characters they created!
            </p>
            <p>
                In Pathfinder 2nd Edition, when a player's character attempts an especially difficult task, such as casting a spell or forcing open a door, they 
                sometime roll dice to see if they succeed or not! Based on how they built their character, they might have special abilites or skills that can help!
            </p>
            <p>
                It's the Game Master's job to describe how the players' actions go, what other creatures in the world say, and generally describe what goes on in the fantastical world the group plays in!
